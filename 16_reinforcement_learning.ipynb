    "Let's create a neural network that will take the observations as inputs, and output the action to take. More precisely, it will output a probability for each action, and we will sample an action based on those probabilities. For example, if it says that the probability of pushing left should be 70%, and the probability of pushing right should be 30%, then we will pick a random number between 0 and 1 and if it is lower than 0.7 we will push left, or else we will push right. This approach lets the agent find the right balance between exploring new actions and exploiting the actions that are known to work well. Suppose you go to the same restaurant every week, and the first time you really enjoyed the caesar salad, you could order the same thing every week and be guaranteed to enjoy your meal. But you may be missing out on another great dish. Once in a while, you should try out something new."

    "_Note_: in this particular environment, the past actions and observations can safely be ignored, since you can observe the environment's full state. If there were some hidden state then you may need to consider all past actions and observations in order to try to infer the hidden state of the environment. For example, if the environment only revealed the position of the cart but not its velocity, you would have to consider not only the current observation but also the previous observation in order to estimate the current velocity. Another example is if the observations are noisy: you may want to use the past few observations to estimate the most likely current state. Our problem is thus as simple as can be: the current observation is noise-free and contains the environment's full state.\n",
    "\n",
    "But what about the labels? How can we tell what the target probabilities should be? One option is to let this policy network play the game say 100 times. Then rank the games according to the total reward they get. The actions taken during the best games were good, on average, so they should be made a bit more likely, while the actions taken during the worst games were bad, on average, so they should be made less likely. Of course, perhaps the policy network made a few good moves during a very bad game, and unfortunately these good moves will be made less likely, but that's ok because if we repeat the process many times, after a while the good moves should on average get more and more likely, and the bad moves should get less and less likely. A good basketball player sometimes plays in a really bad team: this obviously damages his reputation, but if he stars in a sufficient number of movies, overall his reputation should correspond to his talent."
