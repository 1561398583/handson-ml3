Our problem is thus as simple as can be: the current observation is noise-free and contains the environment's full state."

    "You may wonder why we plan to pick a random action based on the probability given by the policy network, rather than just picking the action with the highest probability. This approach lets the agent find the right balance between _exploring_ new actions and _exploiting_ the actions that are known to work well. Here's an analogy: suppose you go to a restaurant for the first time, and all the dishes look equally appealing so you randomly pick one. If it turns out to be good, you can increase the probability to order it next time, but you shouldn't increase that probability to 100%, or else you will never try out the other dishes, some of which may be even better than the one you tried."

    "1. Reinforcement Learning is an area of Machine Learning aimed at creating agents capable of taking actions in an environment in a way that maximizes rewards over time. There are many differences between RL and regular supervised and unsupervised learning. Here are a few:\n",
    "    * In supervised and unsupervised learning, the goal is generally to find patterns in the data and use them to make predictions. In Reinforcement Learning, the goal is to find a good policy.\n",
    "    * Unlike in supervised learning, the agent is not explicitly given the \"right\" answer. It must learn by trial and error.\n",
    "    * Unlike in unsupervised learning, there is a form of supervision, through rewards. We do not tell the agent how to perform the task, but we do tell it when it is making progress or when it is failing.\n",
    "    * A Reinforcement Learning agent needs to find the right balance between exploring the environment, looking for new ways of getting rewards, and exploiting sources of rewards that it already knows. In contrast, supervised and unsupervised learning systems generally don't need to worry about exploration; they just feed on the training data they are given.\n",
    "    * In supervised and unsupervised learning, training instances are typically independent (in fact, they are generally shuffled). In Reinforcement Learning, consecutive observations are generally _not_ independent. An agent may remain in the same region of the environment for a while before it moves on, so consecutive observations will be very correlated. In some cases a replay memory (buffer) is used to ensure that the training algorithm gets fairly independent observations.\n",
    "2. Here are a few possible applications of Reinforcement Learning, other than those mentioned in Chapter 18:\n",
    "    * Music personalization: The environment is a user's personalized web radio. The agent is the software deciding what song to play next for that user. Its possible actions are to play any song in the catalog (it must try to choose a song the user will enjoy) or to play an advertisement (it must try to choose an ad that the user will be interested in). It gets a small reward every time the user listens to a song, a larger reward every time the user listens to an ad, a negative reward when the user skips a song or an ad, and a very negative reward if the user leaves.\n",
    "    * Marketing: The environment is your company's marketing department. The agent is the software that defines which customers a mailing campaign should be sent to, given their profile and purchase history (for each customer it has two possible actions: send or don't send). It gets a negative reward for the cost of the mailing campaign, and a positive reward for estimated revenue generated from this campaign.\n",
    "    * Product delivery: Let the agent control a fleet of delivery trucks, deciding what they should pick up at the depots, where they should go, what they should drop off, and so on. It will get positive rewards for each product delivered on time, and negative rewards for late deliveries.\n",
    "3. When estimating the value of an action, Reinforcement Learning algorithms typically sum all the rewards that this action led to, giving more weight to immediate rewards and less weight to later rewards (considering that an action has more influence on the near future than on the distant future). To model this, a discount factor is typically applied at each time step. For example, with a discount factor of 0.9, a reward of 100 that is received two time steps later is counted as only 0.9<sup>2</sup> × 100 = 81 when you are estimating the value of the action. You can think of the discount factor as a measure of how much the future is valued relative to the present: if it is very close to 1, then the future is valued almost as much as the present; if it is close to 0, then only immediate rewards matter. Of course, this impacts the optimal policy tremendously: if you value the future, you may be willing to put up with a lot of immediate pain for the prospect of eventual rewards, while if you don't value the future, you will just grab any immediate reward you can find, never investing in the future.\n",
    "4. To measure the performance of a Reinforcement Learning agent, you can simply sum up the rewards it gets. In a simulated environment, you can run many episodes and look at the total rewards it gets on average (and possibly look at the min, max, standard deviation, and so on).\n",
    "5. The credit assignment problem is the fact that when a Reinforcement Learning agent receives a reward, it has no direct way of knowing which of its previous actions contributed to this reward. It typically occurs when there is a large delay between an action and the resulting reward (e.g., during a game of Atari's _Pong_, there may be a few dozen time steps between the moment the agent hits the ball and the moment it wins the point). One way to alleviate it is to provide the agent with shorter-term rewards, when possible. This usually requires prior knowledge about the task. For example, if we want to build an agent that will learn to play chess, instead of giving it a reward only when it wins the game, we could give it a reward every time it captures one of the opponent's pieces.\n",
    "6. An agent can often remain in the same region of its environment for a while, so all of its experiences will be very similar for that period of time. This can introduce some bias in the learning algorithm. It may tune its policy for this region of the environment, but it will not perform well as soon as it moves out of this region. To solve this problem, you can use a replay memory; instead of using only the most immediate experiences for learning, the agent will learn based on a buffer of its past experiences, recent and not so recent (perhaps this is why we dream at night: to replay our experiences of the day and better learn from them?).\n",
    "7. An off-policy RL algorithm learns the value of the optimal policy (i.e., the sum of discounted rewards that can be expected for each state if the agent acts optimally) while the agent follows a different policy. Q-Learning is a good example of such an algorithm. In contrast, an on-policy algorithm learns the value of the policy that the agent actually executes, including both exploration and exploitation."

    "Moreover, you should always ensure that the preprocessed images contain enough information to play the game. For example, the blasts from the laser cannon and from the aliens should still be visible despite the limited resolution. In this particular case, the preprocessing we did for Breakout still works fine for Space Invaders, but that's something you should always check if you want try other games. To do this, you can let the agent play randomly for a while, and record the preprocessed frames, then play the animation and ensure the game still looks playable.\n",

    "You will also need to let the agent train for quite a long time to get good performance. Sadly, the DQN algorithm is not able to reach superhuman level on Space Invaders, likely because humans are able to learn efficient long term strategies in this game, whereas DQN can only master fairly short strategies. But there has been a lot of progress over the past few years, and now many other RL algorithms are able to surpass human experts at this game.

    "_Exercise: If you have about $100 to spare, you can purchase a Raspberry Pi 3 plus some cheap robotics components, install TensorFlow on the Pi, and go wild! For an example, check out this [fun post](https://homl.info/2) by Lukas Biewald, or take a look at GoPiGo or BrickPi. Start with simple goals, like making the robot turn around to find the brightest angle (if it has a light sensor) or the closest object (if it has a sonar sensor), and move in that direction. Then you can start using Deep Learning: for example, if the robot has a camera, you can try to implement an object detection algorithm so it detects people and moves toward them. You can also try to use RL to make the agent learn on its own how to use the motors to achieve that goal. Have fun!_"
